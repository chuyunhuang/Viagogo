## Design Decisions

To ensure a better user experience, I think it's important to keep the design as minimal as possible. More often, the users are overloaded by all the information presented to them, and that makes it harder to make decisions. To encourage ticket purchases, I think it's best to filter out all the noises for the users upon visiting the page thus the landing page only displays location filter for users to quickly get the information that's most important to them! With the users in mind, I asked myself what are the deciding factors for me when going to events - I love a  good deal so the next feature I implemented was the 'Best Deals' page where the user can see and select from a list of prices that are already sorted from lowest to highest.
